- 👋 Hi, I’m @ltenglish
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development and Data Analytics
- 🌱 I’m pretty good with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Looking to learn and experiment with Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something related to Data Analytics.
- 📫 How to reach me: Strike a match in pitch black bathroom, while reciting my username in the mirror three times, I will appear and intentionally mess up your code so minorly, but you won't be able to find where the error is no matter how hard you search.
